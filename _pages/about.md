Nice to meet you. I'm a PhD Candidate at the Federal University of Par√°. I study freshwater ecosystems and use Stable Isotopes and spacial models to investigate scientific questions and support decision making.

My fields of research are applied ecosystem science, rivers and wethlan ecology and management, landscape ecology and structural-funcional connectivity of rivers, environmental science, and ecosystem modelling. Technically, I have skillsets in data science, geographic information systems, and ecologogical statitic analises. 

I enjoy swimming, cycling, and running, and doing creative / artistic things. I also am passionate about ethics, equality, and justice, and believe academics hold a privileged position in society with corresponding responsibility.

Hit me up on the Twitter! @Alejo_Zeta_G
